# Judgeval Custom Scorer Examples

This directory contains examples of custom scorers for the Judgeval platform.

## Prerequisites

Before running these examples, make sure you have:

1. Installed the Judgeval package:
   ```bash
   pip install judgeval
   ```

2. Set up your Judgeval API key and organization ID as environment variables:
   ```bash
   export JUDGMENT_API_KEY="your_api_key"
   export JUDGMENT_ORG_ID="your_org_id"
   ```

## Examples

### 1. Cold Email Generator Scorer (`cold_email_scorer.py`)

This scorer evaluates if a cold email generator properly utilizes all relevant information about the target recipient.

```bash
python cold_email_scorer.py
```

Expected output:
```
Score: 0.6
Reason: Missing information points: achievements
Success: False
```

### 2. Code Review Style Scorer (`code_style_scorer.py`)

This scorer evaluates if code suggestions align with team style preferences.

```bash
python code_style_scorer.py
```

Expected output:
```
Score: 0.33
Reason: Style violations found: Missing required docstrings, Function spacing does not match requirements, Log formatting does not match requirements
Success: False
```

## Customizing the Examples
