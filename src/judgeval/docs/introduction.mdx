Judgeval is an evaluation library for **multi-step LLM systems**. 
Judgeval is designed for AI teams to easily benchmark and iterate on their LLM apps and was designed to:
- Offer a development and production **quality control layer** for multi-step LLM applications, especially for **agentic systems**.
- **Plug-and-evaluate** LLM systems with 10+ research-backed metrics including hallucination detection, RAG retriever quality, and more.
- Construct powerful custom evaluation pipelines for your LLM systems.
- Monitor LLM systems in production using state-of-the-art **real-time evaluation foundation models**.

Judgeval integrates natively with the **Judgment Labs Platform**, allowing you to evaluate, regression test, 
and monitor LLM applications in the cloud.

Judgeval was built by a passionate team of LLM researchers from **Stanford, Datadog, and Together AI**.
