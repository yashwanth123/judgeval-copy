"""
Code that implements a prompt-based scorer for evaluating examples.

The PromptScorer class is a base class that can be used to create custom scoring metrics using LLM prompts.
To implement a subclass of PromptScorer, you need to implement the following methods:
- build_measure_prompt(): builds the conversation prompt that is sent to the LLM judge
- build_schema(): defines the expected response schema from the LLM
- process_response(): parses the response from the LLM judge
- success_check(): determines whether the evaluation was successful

The core idea of PromptScorer is to provide a flexible way to create custom scoring metrics
by leveraging LLM judges to evaluate examples. The scorer constructs a prompt, sends it to
the judge, and parses the structured response to determine a score.

For example, the SentimentScorer subclass uses PromptScorer to detect negative sentiment in responses
by prompting an LLM to rate the negativity on a 1-5 scale and provide a reason for the rating.

The PromptScorer supports both synchronous and asynchronous evaluation modes, includes optional
reason fields in responses, and can operate in strict mode with higher thresholds.

NOTE: When implementing build_measure_prompt and build_schema:
- The prompt should guide the LLM to generate a response matching your schema
- The schema should include "score" and optionally "reason" fields
- The score field type and range should match your scoring criteria
- The reason field provides explanatory context for the score
